## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

The Jerry Zinger Show allows the PC and his companions to view (and take part in) the live talk show of Jerry Zinger, well known Amnish celebrity! Shows are daily, and executed largely by cutscenes. The programme is as follows:
- "My ex is an evil mastermind" (Irenicus, Ellesime)
- "Racial tension" (Korgan)
- "Leaving with my lover" (Rumar)
- "Families Reunited" (Aerie)
- No name (Newb)
- "Knights who wear Lingerie and and the women who love them" (Keldorn)
- "Latex Gnomes" (Seifer, SConrad)
- "My husband's mistress" (Keldorn, Viconia)
- "Who's your daddy?" (Aerie)

Note that the episodes featuring a NPC are only viewable if the NPC is currently in the party, and not dead. The other episodes are viewable no matter what party you have. You will not be able to choose which episode to view. They will display in the given order where possible.

<p>

- **Fully Fledged Introduction Movie!** SConrad and Jezil'jin have together created an introduction movie, and with SConrad's pioneering technique it has been included in the mod.
- **New Area:** A new area based on the Playhouse, made by BLUE_CHIP, is included in the mod. This area is the Jerry Zinger Studio where the episodes play out. The Jerry Zinger Studio is available through the the Den of Seven Vales, the inn north of the Circus in Waukeen's Promenade. The entrance is located on the south-east wall of the first floor of the inn, just slightly to the right of the point where you first enter the Den of Seven Vales.
- **Comprehensive Voicing!** Jerry Zinger is voiced by TheWizard, and SConrad and Seifer are also voicing themselves. Aerie's (two) fathers, Sir William of Thorpe, and Rumar are voiced by Shed and Tris.
